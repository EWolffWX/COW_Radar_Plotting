# DOW/COW Radar Plotting

This repository contains code related to plotting and editing data from the Illinois FARM Doppler on Wheels (DOW) and C-Band on Wheels (COW) radars. Initially, this includes a notebook which uses py-ART to view and edit cfradial files from the COW.

In the future, tutorials for HawkEye and more advanced py-ART tools may be added as well.
